# CalculateBMIs

Coding Exercise1 #1
Mack and Mobi are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mack's and Mobi's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'MackHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mack has a higher BMI than Mobi.
Test data:
Â§Data 1: Macks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. Mobi weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§Data 2: Macks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. Mobi weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
