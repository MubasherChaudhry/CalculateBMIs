    <title>Calculate BMIs</title>

    <h1>Coding Exercise #1</h1>

    <p>
      Mack and Mobi are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height *
      height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Store Mack's and Mobi's mass and height in variables</li>
      <li>
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Boolean variable 'MackHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mack has a higher BMI than Mobi.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data 1: Mack weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. Mobi weights 92 kg and is
        1.95 m tall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data 2: Mack weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. Mobi weights 85 kg and is
        1.76 m tall.
      </li>
    </ul>
